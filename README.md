## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env

# Install dependencies (macOS)
brew install sqlite3
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/loveandsqualor/houseplant.app.git
cd houseplant.app-1

# Environment setup
cp .env.example .env
echo "DATABASE_URL=sqlite:houseplants.db" > .env

# Build and run
cargo build --release
cargo run

# Access application
open http://localhost:8080
```

### Docker Deployment

#### Quick Docker Start
```bash
# Build and run using our simplified script
./run-docker.sh

# Access application (default admin login)
# Email: admin@houseplant.app
# Password: admin123
open http://localhost:8082
```

#### Using Docker Compose
```bash
# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Access application
open http://localhost:8082
```

#### Manual Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy with script
./deploy.sh

# Or custom build
./custom-build.sh

# Test functionality
./test-flow.sh
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Blank Admin Pages
If you encounter blank admin pages when running the application in Docker:

1. **Check Docker Configuration**: 
   - Ensure you're exposing port 8080 from the container
   - Make sure your APP_HOST is set to `0.0.0.0` in .env, not `127.0.0.1`

2. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Verify you're logged in as admin (admin@houseplant.app / admin123)
   - Check SESSION_SECRET_KEY is properly set in your .env file

3. **Template Path Resolution**:
   - If templates still don't render, check logs for path resolution issues:
   - Set RUST_LOG=debug in .env for detailed logging

4. **Port Forwarding**:
   - Ensure you're accessing the correct port (8084 if using docker-compose.yml)
   - The default application port inside the container is 8080

## üß™ Testing & Quality

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Core business logic validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end user flows
